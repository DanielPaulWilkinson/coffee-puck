(1, 'Arabica', 'Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) is one of the two primary species of coffee beans commonly grown and consumed around the world. It is renowned for its exceptional flavor, considered to be of higher quality compared to the other primary coffee species, Robusta. Here are some key characteristics and information about Arabica coffee:\r\n\r\nFlavor Profile: Arabica coffee is celebrated for its wide range of flavor profiles. It often features bright acidity, a smooth and mild taste, and a variety of complex flavor notes. These notes can include floral, fruity, nutty, chocolatey, or even earthy tones, depending on the region and growing conditions.\r\n\r\nCultivation: Arabica coffee plants are typically grown at higher altitudes, usually between 2,000 and 6,000 feet (600 to 1,800 meters) above sea level. They require specific conditions, including moderate temperatures, consistent rainfall, and protection from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nCaffeine Content: Arabica beans have lower caffeine content compared to Robusta coffee beans, making them milder and less bitter. This lower caffeine content contributes to their smoother and less harsh flavor.\r\n\r\nShape and Size: Arabica coffee beans are typically oval or slightly curved with a smooth surface. They are smaller and more elongated compared to Robusta beans.\r\n\r\nGrowing Regions: Arabica coffee is grown in various regions around the world, including Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia. Each region imparts its unique characteristics to the coffee, resulting in a diverse array of Arabica varietals.\r\n\r\nProcessing Methods: Arabica coffee beans are often processed using methods such as washed, natural, or honey-processed, which can influence the flavor and aroma of the final cup.\r\n\r\nMarket Share: Arabica coffee accounts for a significant portion of the global coffee market and is a staple in specialty coffee shops and high-end coffee blends.\r\n\r\nEconomic Importance: Arabica coffee is a crucial source of income for many coffee-producing regions, and its quality and flavor play a vital role in the global coffee trade.\r\n\r\nArabica coffee is often considered the gold standard for coffee enthusiasts and is the cornerstone of the specialty coffee industry. Its cultivation requires specific conditions, and it is associated with higher elevations and specialty coffee production. Arabica beans are used to create a wide variety of coffee beverages, appreciated for their nuanced and sophisticated flavors.', 0, '1', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

(2, 'Robusta', 'Robusta coffee (Coffea canephora) is one of the two primary species of coffee beans that are widely cultivated and consumed worldwide, with the other being Arabica coffee. Robusta coffee is known for its distinct characteristics, and it plays a significant role in the global coffee industry. Here are some key characteristics and information about Robusta coffee:\r\n\r\nFlavor Profile: Robusta coffee is characterized by a strong and robust flavor profile. It typically has a bitter and earthy taste with nutty and woody undertones. The flavor is less complex and more straightforward compared to Arabica.\r\n\r\nCultivation: Robusta coffee plants are hardier and more resilient compared to Arabica. They can thrive at lower altitudes, often between sea level and 2,000 feet (0 to 600 meters) above sea level. They are less sensitive to temperature fluctuations and are more resistant to pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nCaffeine Content: Robusta beans contain a significantly higher caffeine content than Arabica beans. This increased caffeine contributes to the coffee''s bitterness and acts as a natural pesticide, deterring many pests.\r\n\r\nShape and Size: Robusta coffee beans are typically rounder and smaller than Arabica beans, with a straighter, slightly concave side.\r\n\r\nGrowing Regions: Robusta coffee is commonly grown in regions with lower altitudes and warmer climates. It is produced in several countries, with Vietnam being one of the largest Robusta coffee producers in the world.\r\n\r\nBlending: While Robusta coffee is less popular as a single-origin specialty coffee, it is often used in coffee blends. It is particularly valued for its ability to add body, a thicker crema to espresso, and a more consistent flavor profile.\r\n\r\nEconomic Importance: Robusta coffee is a crucial component of the global coffee market and is commonly used in instant coffee production. It plays a significant role in the coffee industry and contributes to the economies of many coffee-producing regions.\r\n\r\nRobusta Varieties: There are different varieties and subspecies of Robusta coffee, each with its own characteristics, although they are less celebrated in the specialty coffee world.\r\n\r\nRobusta coffee is prized for its resilience and adaptability to a wide range of environmental conditions, making it an essential crop in regions where Arabica may not thrive as well. While it has a different flavor profile from Arabica, it is a crucial component in the coffee industry and is used in various coffee products and blends worldwide.', 0, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);

(6, 'Java', 'Java has a long history of cultivation. As indicated by the name, the variety was introduced to the island of Java directly from Ethiopia by the Dutch in the early 19th century.It was originally thought to be a Typica selection. In the mid-20th century, it was brought to Cameroon by a local farmer via the Vilmorin company, which acquired the seeds in Java from Porteres (a famous breeder). In Cameroon, the breeder Pierre Bouharmont observed that it was partially tolerant to coffee berry disease (CBD), a prevalent problem for coffee growers in Africa, and well adapted for smallholder growers using few inputs. After nearly 20 years of selection, it was released for cultivation in Cameroon in 1980-90.Even so, genetic fingerprinting of molecular markers has revealed that Java is a selection from an Ethiopian landrace population called Abysinia.It was introduced to Costa Rica in 1991 by the Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement (CIRAD) by breeder Benoit Bertrand. The objective was to provide options for smallholders using low inputs, as well as for CBD tolerance (CBD is not currently present in Central America, but there is concern it may move to the region). Seeds were sent to PROMECAFE countries, but it was never released in any of the countries. Subsequently Java’s quality potential at high altitudes has been recognized. The first Central American country to officially recognize Java was Panama in 2016.It represents an interesting alternative to the Geisha (Panama), which high cup quality but is more resilient for small farmers with better tolerance of coffee leaf rust and CBD.', 1, 'tall', 'high', 'Ethiopian landrace', 'Ethiopian Landrace', NULL);

From there, it was sent to the Lyamungu research station in Tanzania, and then brought to Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza (CATIE) in Central America in the 1953, where it was logged as accession T2722. It was distributed throughout Panama via CATIE in the 1960s after it had been recognized for tolerance to coffee leaf rust. However, the plant''s branches were brittle and not favored by farmers so it was not widely planted. The coffee came to prominence in 2005 when the Peterson family of Boquete, Panama, entered it into the \"Best of Panama\" competition and auction. It received exceptionally high marks and broke the then-record for green coffee auction prices, selling for over $20/pound.There is significant confusion about Geisha because there are multiple genetically distinct plant types that have been referred to as Geisha, many of which share similar geographic origins in Ethiopia. Recent genetic diversity analyses conducted by World Coffee Research confirm that Panamanian Geisha descendent from T2722 is distinct and uniform. It is associated with extremely high cup quality when the plants are managed well at high altitude, and is known for its delicate floral, jasmine, and peach-like aromas.The spellings Geisha and Gesha are often used interchangeably, relating to the fact that there is no set translation from the dialects of Ethiopia to English. The coffee was first recorded in germplasm records with the spelling “Geisha,” and coffee researchers and germplasm banks have mostly maintained that spelling over many decades, leading that spelling to be promoted and used first in the coffee industry. The coffee was originally collected in Ethiopia in a region close to a mountain whose name is most commonly rendered in English as Gesha. Consequently, many in the coffee industry have preferred to rescue that spelling.', 1, 'tall', 'high', 'Ethiopian landrace', 'Ethiopian Landrace', 'Gesha'),

But beginning in the mid-1800s, the variety spread to new parts of the world as the missionaries moved to establish footholds in Africa and the Americas. The Bourbon variety was introduced to Brazil around 1860, and from there rapidly spread north into other parts of South and Central America, where it is still cultivated today. Here it became mixed with other Bourbon-related varieties, introduced from India as well as Ethiopian landraces. Nowadays, there are many Bourbon-like varieties found in East Africa, but none exactly match the distinct Bourbon variety that can be found in Latin America.

The plant is highly productive compared to Bourbon, in part because of its small size, which allows plants to be closely spaced; it can be planted at nearly double the density. The plant’s shape makes it relatively easy apply pest and disease treatments. It is mainly characterized by great vigor and its low height; it is less compact than Caturra. It is highly susceptible to coffee leaf rust.Catuaí derives from the Guarani multo mom, meaning “very good.\" Today, it is considered to have good but not great cup quality. There are yellow-fruited and red-fruited types, and have since been many selections in different countries. The cultivar was created in 1949 from a crossing of yellow Caturra and Mundo Novo, and initially called H-2077.The variety was released in Brazil 1972 after pedigree selection (selection of individual plants through successive generations) and is in wide cultivation there. In Brazil, there are multiple lines of Catuai available; some are notable for their high productivity. The Catuaí lines transferred to Central America seem to be less productive; studies in Honduras and Costa Rica found no significant differences in productivity have been observed between Caturra and Catuaí.It was first introduced in Honduras in 1979, where it was tested by Instituto Hondureño del Café (IHCAFÉ). It was released commercially in 1983, after IHCAFÉ selected two lines for planting. For a time, Catui accounted for nearly half of the Arabica coffee in cultivation. Researchers at IHCAFÉ are actively pursuing breeding with Catuai, including creating hybrid crosses between Catuai and Timor Hybrid lines.It is also economically important in Costa Rica, where it was introduced in 1985, whose descendants have spread widely through the country. It was introduced into Guatemala in 1970; currently about 20% of the country’s production is Catuai. It has a negligible presence in other Central American countries.Catuai, whose small stature allows it to be planted densely and harvested more efficiently, led in part to the intensification of full-sun coffee cultivation in Central America in the 1970s and 1980s.A similar variety called Garnica was developed by the Mexican Coffee Institute (INMECAFÉ) in 1960-61, through the crossing of Mundo Novo with Caturra Amarillo. Adaptation trials were established in 1978-79, but INMECAFÉ was dissolved in 1989 before pedigree selections were completed.

It was discovered on a plantation in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil sometime between 1915 and 1918.Caturra has a single-gene mutation that causes the plant to grow smaller (called Dwarf/Compactism). Its name derives from the Guarani word meaning \"small.\" It is also called \"Nanico.\" After Caturra’s discovery, selections were made by the Instituto Agronomico (IAC) of Sao Paulo State in Campinas, Brazil, starting in 1937. Breeders were interested in Caturra’s small size, which allows plants to be placed closer together, and its closely spaced secondary branches, which enable it to produce more fruit in the same space.The selection process for Caturra was called mass selection, meaning that a group of individuals are selected based on their superior performance, seed from these plants is bulked to form a new generation, and then the process is repeated. The variety was never officially released in Brazil, but has become common in Central America.It was introduced in Guatemala in the 1940s, but widespread commercial adoption didn’t happen for another three decades. From Guatemala, it was introduced to Costa Rica, Honduras, and Panama. For decades, it was one of the most economically important coffees in Central America, to the extent that it was often used (and sometimes still is) as a “benchmark” against which new cultivars are tested. In Colombia, Caturra was thought to represent nearly half of the country’s production until a government-sponsored program beginning in 2008 incentivised renovation of over three billion coffee trees with the leaf-rust resistant Castillo variety (which has Caturra parentage).Caturra led in part to the intensification of coffee cultivation through higher density planting, often in full sun, that took place in the region in the second half of the 20th century.Caturra is also known for being one of the parents the so-called “Catimor” family of cultivars.

The crisis sparked action. In the 1970s, the coffee research station at Ruiru, which gives Ruiru 11 its name, began an intensive breeding program for varieties that were immune to CBD. This led to the development of Ruiru 11, which was released in 1985.Breeders were focused on creating a compact variety suited to intensive planting, but one that had the high cup quality characteristic of the tall varieties predominant in Africa. Breeders spend many years crossing multiple progenitors to create what breeders call a complex hybrid that would gather the best attributes each of the chosen progenitors. This work resulted in the creation the male parent of Ruiru. The chosen progenitors of Ruiru 11’s complex hybrid male parent conferred resistance to CBD (coming from Rume Sudan, Timor Hybrid lines, and K7) and good cup quality (coming from N39, SL28, SL34 and Bourbon).The female parent of Ruiru 11 was chosen to provide compactness (Dwarf/Compact stature) and an additional layer of both rust and CBD resistance. A small number of Catimor (Caturra x Timor Hybrid) lines were identified to fulfill this requirement (including Catimor 129).The final step in the creation of Ruiru 11 is to cross the tall male complex hybrid parent with the compact Catimor female parent. The resulting group of siblings produces Ruiru 11’s compact stature and resistance to coffee leaf rust and CBD. To mass propagate Ruiru 11, breeders manually pollinate the mother plants with pollen from the male parent lines to produce first-generation (F1) hybrid seed. This final cross results in hybrid vigor, hence high yield. The resulting seeds produce a set of siblings that are mixed together and distributed to farmers. This is called a composite variety.Because Ruiru 11 relies on hand pollination for mass propagation, it has been difficult to produce adequate volumes of seed to meet farmer demand.', 1, 'Dwarf/Compact\r\n', 'low, medium, high', 'Composite variety made of many varieties.

The variety is suited for medium to high altitudes and shows resistance to drought, but is susceptible to the major diseases of coffee. SL28 is notable for its rusticity—a quality meaning that it can be left untended for years or even decades at a time, and then return to successful production. There are SL28 trees in many parts of Kenya that are 60-80 years old and still productive.SL28 was selected at the former Scott Agricultural Laboratories (now the National Agricultural Laboratories, NARL situated at Kabete—more information below). Individual tree selections made at the Scott Laboratories during the 1935-1939 period were prefixed SL. Fourty-two trees of various origins were selected and studied for yield, quality, and drought and disease resistance. SL28 was selected in 1935 from a single tree in a population called Tanganyika Drought Resistant. In 1931, the senior coffee officer of Scott Labs, A.D. Trench, conducted a tour of Tanganyika (now Tanzania). According to historical documents, he noticed a variety growing in the Moduli district that appeared to be tolerant to drought, diseases and pests. Seed was collected and brought back to Scott Laboratories, where its drought resistance was confirmed. It was widely distributed until superseded by its progeny, SL28.

It conducted agricultural research and provided technical advice and training to Kenyan farmers on behalf of the Department of Agriculture. Scott Agricultural Labs employed an entomologist, a mycologist, and a plant breeder. The Coffee Section, previously housed in a central office of the department, was moved to the laboratories in 1934 and had twenty-four acres dedicated to coffee. The name of the unit was derived from the history of its buildings. Constructed in 1913 as a sanatorium and used during the First World War as a war hospital, the buildings were named for Dr. Henry Scott, a missionary from the Church of Scotland. When the Department of Agriculture took over the buildings in 1922, they named them the Scott Agricultural Laboratories. Both Scott Agricultural Laboratories in Kenya and Lyamungo Research Station in Tanganyika became the main centers for coffee breeding in East Africa.Research was conducted at the lab and in cooperation with private estate owners. A history of the labs states: “The trial of imported varieties is a conspicuous feature of the work at the Laboratories…. Selections from individual trees showing desirable characteristics are being grown.” Other coffee work included comparative yield trials, grafting experiments, and effects of pruning, shade trials, and cover crops, among others. In 1944, Kenya decided to move coffee research to a dedicated coffee research station with better facilities for field experiments; Jacaranda Estates (20 miles north of Ruiru) with 380 acres. It became operational in 1949. Substations were also established in Upper Kiambu in 1957, Meru in 1958, Kitale in 1938, Lake Victoria in 1959, and Kisii in 1957.', 1, 'tall', 'medium, high', 'Selection of \"Tanganika Drought Resistant.\" Bourbon-like genetic background.', 'Bourbon-Typica group (Bourbon related)\r\n', NULL),

The tree was labeled “French Mission.”French missionaries known as Spiritans established a mission in 1893 at Bura (Taita Hills, Kenya), in which Bourbon coffee seeds originating from La Réunion island were planted. The seedlings from Bura were brought to another French Mission in Saint Austin (near Nairobi) in 1899, and from there seeds were distributed to settlers willing to grow coffee. This is the origin of so-called French Mission coffee.Because of the historical movement of coffee seeds directly from La Réunion via the French missionaries, French Mission is widely understood to be another name for Bourbon.

So far, Starmaya is the only F1 hybrid in the world propagated by seed, rather than through costly biotechnology. Before Starmaya, the only way to efficiently reproduce F1 hybrids for farmers has been through cloning (tissue culture cloning/somatic embryogenesis) or manual pollination of the mother and father plants, both of which methods are costly and have limited capacity. F1 hybrid varieties are still relatively new in coffee agriculture; only a handful have become commercially available to farmers in the last 15 years, and only in select countries.As early as 1998, coffee breeders recognized that it would be theoretically possible to propagate F1 hybrids via seed if one of the parent plants were sterile. If you place two different fertile coffee varieties—your desired hybrid Mother and Father varieties—together in a typical field of coffee, some offspring would be the result of Mother to Mother crossing (resulting in offspring that look like the Mother), some Father to Father (offspring like the Father), and only some would be Mother to Father (offspring hybrids of the two). This is obviously an inefficient way to produce hybrid seed.However, if one of the varieties in the field is sterile (meaning it does not produce pollen), then any offspring (e.g., coffee cherries, the product of sexual reproduction of the Mother and Father) that appear on male sterile plants must be hybrids between Mother x Father. Wind or pollinators would carry the pollen from the pollen-producing variety onto the sterile variety, and the resulting cherries would necessarily be hybrids. The challenge was to find a naturally male sterile plant that could be a suitable breeding parent.In 2001, researchers from Centre de coopération internationale en recherche agronomique pour le développement (CIRAD) collaborating in a public-private coffee breeding project with ECOM, noticed a male-sterile Arabica plant growing in a population of wild Ethiopian and Sudanese coffees on the La Cumplida farm in Nicaragua.

In Central America, it was given the designation T5175 (“T” represents Turrialba, where the CATIE research station is based).In Honduras, additional selection of T5175 led to the creation of IHCAFE 90 and Lempira.For more background on the history of the Catimor group of coffees, see T8667.', 1, 'Dwarf/Compact\r\n', 'low, medium', 'Timor Hybrid 832/1 x Caturra\r\n', 'Introgressed (Catimor related)\r\n', 'Catimor'),

Cuscatleco and Parainema are both pedigree selections of T5296 made by national breeding programs in El Salvador and Honduras, respectively. In addition, many of the newer F1 hybrid varieties were created by crossing T5296 with Ethiopian landraces (examples include Centroamericano, Milenio, and Mundo Maya). T5296 has its origins with the earliest days of the Central American regional consortium called PROMECAFE, which was founded in 1978 with funding from USAID’s Regional Office for Central American Programs (ROCAP) and Instituto Agronômico de Campinas (IAC) in Brazil to respond to the threat posed by the recent arrival of coffee leaf rust in the region. Detailed history of the Sarchimor group of varietiesIn 1958 or 1959, the Centro de Investigação das Ferrugens do Cafeeiro of Portugal (CIFC), famous for its research into coffee leaf rust, received a lot of Timor Hybrid seeds from the island of Timor. Timor Hybrid is a natural cross between C. arabica and C. canephora (Robusta) that appeared spontaneously on the island of Timor in 1920s. Its Robusta genetics conferred rust resistance into the variety. From the two shipments of seeds that CIFC received, they had selected two plants for use in breeding based on their high resistance to leaf rust. In 1967, breeders in Portugal began work to create new varieties of coffee that would be resistant to the disease, but also have a compact stature that could be planted more densely. One of the rust-resistant Timor Hybrid plants, called HDT CIFC 832/2, was crossed with compact Villa Sarchi to create hybrid 361 (H361). The hybrid was dubbed “Sarchimor.” They created the hybrid just in time for the arrival of leaf rust in the Americas.After some initial testing at IAC in Brazil, in 1971 CIFC sent H361 out for field trials in experimental centers in several countries, including Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Laos, Malawi, Mozambique, Sao Tome, Thailand and Venezuela. In response to the crisis, Central American countries banded together to form the Regional Cooperative Program for the Technological Development and Modernization of the Coffee Industry (PROMECAFE) in 1978. In Central America, H361 was first sent to the Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza (CATIE) research station in Costa Rica. The population studied there was given the designation T5296 (“T” represents Turrialba, where CATIE is based). The work of selective breeding on T5296 was led by researcher AJ Bettencourt. From this central trial, T5296 was sent out to national breeding programs in the region. In Honduras, further generations of selection led to the variety that is known as Parainema. In El Salvador, further generations of selection led to the variety that is known as Cuscatleco. In Puerto Rico, the Sarchimor population was called Limani. Similar selections were done in Brazil to create Obata (Red), Tupi, and IAPAR 59.It’s important to note that, contrary to common belief, \"Sarchimor\" is not iteself a distinct variety. Instead, it is a group of many different distinct varieties with similar parentage.', 1, 'Dwarf/Compact\r\n', 'low, medium', 'Timor Hybrid CIFC 832/2 x Villa Sarchi\r\n', 'Introgressed (Sarchimor related)\r\n', 'Sarchimor'),

Their designation for the cross was H26. In Central America, it was given the designation T-8667 (“T” represents Turrialba, where the CATIE research station is based). Private farms in Central America did further \"mass selection\" of T-8667 (\"mass selection\" means that a group of individuals are selected based on their superior performance, seed from these plants is bulked to form a new generation, and then the process is repeated), and seed from these experiments was distributed throughout the region, particularly in the late 1980s. In Costa Rica, CATIE performed additional selection of T-8667 to create Costa Rica 95; IHCAFE in Honduras did the same to create the variety Lempira; and El Salvador did the same to create Catisic.In 1958 or 1959, the CIFC, famous for its research into coffee leaf rust, received a lot of Timor Hybrid seeds from the island of Timor.

It’s important to note that, contrary to common belief, Catimor is not a distinct variety. Instead, it is a group of many different distinct varieties with similar parentage.In Malawi, the Coffee Research Unit of the Tea Research Foundation adopted five Catimor progenies. In Papua New Guinea, six Catimor lines were selected and released.

(64, 'Tekisic', 'A selection of the Bourbon variety made by the Salvadoran Institute for Coffee Research (ISIC) beginning in the 1949 and released in 1977. The selection process for Tekisic was called \"mass selection,\" meaning that a group of individuals are selected based on their superior performance, seed from these plants is bulked to form a new generation, and then the process is repeated. Breeders achieved a variety that ripens early, has very good quality potential on optimal conditions, and has higher production than unselected Bourbons between 900 and 1500 meters. Unfortunately, the variety is not resistant to major diseases including coffee leaf rust.The name Tekisic comes from tekiti, a word meaning “work” in the Nahuatl language, and ISIC. It was indeed a lot of work to create the variety—the Salvadoran Institute for Coffee Research (ISIC) spent nearly 30 years performing selections to create it, beginning in the 1949 and culminating with its release in 1977. It is widespread in El Salvador, where Tekisic and unselected Bourbon make up nearly 70% of coffee production. It is also economically important in Guatemala.Since Tekisic is merely a selection of the Bourbon variety, the story of Tekisic is really the story of Bourbon—one of the most culturally and genetically important C. Arabica coffees in the world. For more, see Bourbon. Latin America breeders such as those at ISIC have exploited the narrow genetic base of Bourbon to create new cultivars that have improved performance in various traits—yield, quality, etc.', 1, 'tall', 'high', 'A selection of the Bourbon variety\r\n', 'Bourbon-Typica group (Bourbon related)\r\n', 'Improved Bourbon\r\n'),
(65, 'Typica', 'Typica is the most famous of the Typica-descended varieties. It is a tall variety characterized by very low production, susceptibility to the major diseases, and good cup quality.The Typica group, like all Arabica coffee, is supposed to have originated in southwestern Ethiopia. Sometime in the 15th or 16th century, it was taken to Yemen. By 1700, seeds from Yemen were being cultivated in India. In 1696 and 1699, coffee seeds were sent from the Malabar coast of India to the island of Batavia (today called Java in Indonesia). These few seeds were the ones to give rise to what we now know as the distinct Typica variety. In 1706 a single Typica coffee plant was taken from Java to Amsterdam and given a home in the botanical gardens; from there, a plant was shared with France in 1714.From the Netherlands, Typica was sent in 1719 on colonial trade routes to Dutch Guiana (now Suriname) and then on to Cayenne (French Guiana) in 1722, and from there to the northern part of Brazil in 1727. It reached southern Brazil between 1760 and 1770. From Paris, plants were sent to to Martinique in the West Indies in 1723. The English introduced Typica coffee from Martinique to Jamaica in 1730. It reached Santo Domingo in 1735. From Santo Domingo, seeds were sent to Cuba in 1748. Later on, Costa Rica (1779) and El Salvador (1840) received seeds from Cuba.In the late eighteenth century, cultivation spread to the Caribbean (Cuba, Puerto Rico, Santo Domingo), Mexico and Colombia, and from there across Central America (it was grown in El Salvador as early as 1740). Until the 1940s, the majority of coffee plantations in South and Central America were planted with Typica. Because Typica is both low yielding and highly susceptible to major coffee diseases, it has gradually been replaced across much of the Americas, but is still widely planted in Peru, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica, where it is called Jamaica Blue Mountain.', 1, 'tall', 'high', 'Also called Criollo (Creole), Indio (Indian), Arábigo (Arabica), Plume Hidalgo, Blue Mountain, and Sumatra.', 'Bourbon-Typica group (Typica related)\r\n', NULL),

It is not widely grown outside Costa Rica, though was introduced to Honduras in 1974 by IHCAFE.It is known for being well-adpated to the highest altitude conditions and tolerant of strong winds.Villa Sarchi is perhaps most well known as one of the namesakes of the “Sarchimor” group of coffees. In the 1970s, coffee breeders and growers in Latin America, as well as the global coffee industry that depended on coffee from the region, were extremely concerned about the recent arrival of coffee leaf rust in Latin America.In 1958 or 1959, the Centro de Investigação das Ferrugens do Cafeeiro of Portugal (CIFC), famous for its research into coffee leaf rust, received two shipments of Timor Hybrid seeds.
